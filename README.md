Project Overview
This repository leverages Python libraries and external APIs to create a voice assistant capable of performing tasks such as responding to voice commands, processing natural language, and integrating with various services. The project is designed to be modular and easy to extend for custom use cases.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
A code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
API keys for the services you plan to use (e.g., speech-to-text, text-to-speech APIs)

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-voice-assistant.git
cd ai-voice-assistant

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies.
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure API Keys
Create a .env file in the root directory to store your API keys securely. Example:
SPEECH_API_KEY=your_speech_api_key
TEXT_API_KEY=your_text_api_key

Replace your_speech_api_key and your_text_api_key with the actual keys from your API provider.
5. Run the Application
Execute the main script to start the voice assistant.
python filename.py

Replace filename.py with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., main.py).
Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, the voice assistant should start listening for commands. Ensure your microphone and speakers are connected and configured properly. You can customize the assistant's behavior by modifying the script or adding new features.
